				<h3>Rachelle Peters</h3>
				<h4>Cannabis Salve</h4>
				<p>While vacationing in Hawaii, I experienced a long fall down a rock face of a mountain.  I had scrapes and cuts to 40% of body.  As I was travelling in the United States, I did not have my Cannalife salve with me.  I watched the skin healing process for next few days of my vacation.  As soon as I returned home, I applied Cannalife salve to my wounds.  The difference I saw overnight was astonishing!  The salve seemed to accelerate the wound healing by at least 50% compared to the daily healing witnessed without the salve. Truly amazing.</p>

				<h3>Lola Danielle Frost </h3>
				<h4>Cannabis Salve</h4>
				<p>I use Cannalife on the daily. As a professional entertainer and dance teacher I find it not only soothing for my skin and senses but incredibly helpful for joint pain and bruising. It’s unlike most products as it’s made with love in small batches really comes through in the quality and feel. I love it.</p>
